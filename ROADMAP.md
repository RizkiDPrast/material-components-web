# MDC Web Roadmap
We release a new version of MDC Web every 2 weeks. We also limit our breaking changes to one release at the end of the month.
This roadmap contains tentative plans for MDC Web releases in the near future, based on the more general
[Material Components roadmap](https://github.com/material-components/material-components/blob/develop/ROADMAP.md).

## Current Release

### 0.41.0 - October 2018 (R20)
- Enhanced Select variant (MDC Select using MDC Menu)

## Future Releases

### 0.42.0 - November 2018 (R21)
- SVG-less Notched Outline
- Dialog and List improvements

### 0.42.x - December 2018

- Polish and bug fixes

Note: A full release with breaking changes is not planned for December.
